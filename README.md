# Ricochet Robots Solver

A small implementation of the game Ricochet Robots, intended as a way to check for efficient solutions.

The project originated as a way for me to learn about HTML and JS.
I also intend to use it to be as obnoxious as possible around the giant board at a coming board games night.

## What remains to be done ?

### Functionalities

- [x] Give the option to modify the board layout.
- [x] Give a way to set the position of the robots.
- [ ] \(Optional) Handle the free-for-all goal tile.
- [ ] \(Optional) Handle correctly solutions with the same number of moves (the fewer robots moved the better).

### Optimization

- [ ] Overall cleanup of the code.
- [ ] Further optimizations: Not considering going backwards ? Priorizing paths that reduce the distance ?

### UI

- [x] Improvements of the UI for use on a mobile screen.
- [x] \(Not sure) Through usage of `canvas` ? Just with resizeable HTML elements ? For the moment priorizing the latter.
